[" that James Holmes murder trial heard more from the defendant in his videotaped interview with a court-appointed psychiatrist. Holmes had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the Colorado movie theater massacre that left 12 people dead and 70 injured. In the video he recounts the events of that July night in 2012. Here's Barry Peterson."

 ' Holmes was matter of fact as he described the theater massacre from his point of view. He faked a phone call to explain going out the exit door. Outside in his car, he calmly armed himself and suited up in body armor. Then he went back in to begin his murderous and methodical killing.'
 ' Call Keto. Call and collect it. Call and collect it.'
 ' He emptied his six-round shotgun, then started firing his assault rifle.'
 ' You heard a scream again.' ' Did you see anyone fall from big hit?'
 ' Oh.'
 " Really? Um, they got down kind of behind the seats pretty fast. You didn't see anyone actually hit by bullets? Or shells? Or shots? I saw the one wounded guy they carried out. The psychiatrist asked Holmes to imagine what it was like for the people in the theater. His targets. What do people feel?"
 " they're experiencing that? Terror, I would say."
 ' He called what he did a mission. How did he want to be remembered?'
 ' as mentally ill were different from the norm.' ' Who else?'
 ' being successful with the mission.'
 " He was asked about the death penalty and said originally he wasn't going to oppose it. But then in the videotape, with families and victims listening in the courtroom, he said he will now fight it, Charlie, because his death, as he put it, would make his family sad."
 " court, crusty p vindict shocked they're both child and school leaders reporting live in corners of Washington,CHUCK honourablez"
 ' the man himself. Thanks Barry.']

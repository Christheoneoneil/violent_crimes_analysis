I've been watching Bowling for Columbine. How am I different than what the media says school shooters are? TV I watch: Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien, Family Guy, SNL, Mad TV, Simpsons, Law and Order, Monk, and others. oh, South Park! Man Show (Jimmy + Ad Music: Country music! Toby Keith! Movies: ok, movie I watch have some violence. Groose Pointe Blank, South Park, The Frighteners, Cruel Intentions, Animal House, Blown Away, 10 Things I Hate About You (yes a chick flick) and others, just ask my friends. I like to laugh! Comedies are good! I'm not what the media says I should be. But why Columbia (other than I hate it for obvious reasons)? About eleven months ago, I was in Four Winds. I told a couple people (Barry, Brad) because they wouldn't care. But I guess everyone knew. And one day, Four Winds received a fax about people from Columbia saying that I said "I am going to kill myself and no one can stop me." I figure that's why I was there longer than I should have. So Columbia, IT'S YOUR FAULT. 193

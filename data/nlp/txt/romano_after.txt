It was said that I "studied" Columbine and was trying to repeat it. That's just ridiculous. Plenty of things were said by the D.A. that were ridiculous, like that I wasn't sorry. I've prayed for all those who were affected on that day. I've apologized to many, and been forgiven by many more. I now pray for those killed, wounded, and for the family of all those affected in the latest shooting in Minnesota. Please nobody follow in mine or other's footsteps by bringing a weapon to school. Please don't even try to take your own life. Life is too precious whether you notice or not. Always remember if you hurt yourself or others, you'll also be hurting your family and loved ones or theirs. Jon Romano 195

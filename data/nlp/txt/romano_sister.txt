Jon Romano (Letter to his Sister) Rachel, It's January 24, 2004 and you're leaving home. This time, I have a feeling you'll be gone for a long time. Next thing you'll know, I'll be out of here! Life goes by quick. This letter is just to say good-bye, and I can't wait to end up with something like Mom and her siblings have, with you, Jay and Matt. Me and you have been hanging out lately, but I can't wait for the future. Just think about ten years from now. What will you do? Where will you live? Will you have kids? Be married? These questions apply for me, Jay and Matt too. Will you be Aunt Dex? LOL. What about thirty years from now? Will we all have kids? Will they get along? Who knows we'll find out soon enough. Love, Jon 189

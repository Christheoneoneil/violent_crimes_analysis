To whom it may concern,\
Today is the last day of my horrible days. The end.I do have a few request\
Please leave my casket open at the funeral. Please cremate me after the funeral. Spread my ashes across the mountains of eagle bluff. There are only three people that I have ever really loved my dad my papa, Kent, mama, polly. I am always so sad now. I need feel joy ever. I hope my room is left the same. If I had a razor blade I would leave a sample of my blood on this paper. One of the main parts of my depression is Cristy. She bosses me around. And dad loves her more than me. That drives me literally crazy. THE END. Love, \
Kenneth Stuart Bartley\

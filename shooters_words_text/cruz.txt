All right. So here's the plan. I'm gonna go take Uber in the afternoon before 2:40. From there I'll go into the -- onto school campus, walk up the stairs, unload my bags and get my AR and shoot people down at the main -- what is it? -- the main courtyard, wait, and people will die. Today is the day. The day that it all begins. The day of my massacre shall begin. All the kids in school will run and fear and hide. From the wrath of my power they will know who I am.
I am nothing. I am no one. My life is nothing and meaningless. Everything that I hold dear I let go beyond your half. Every day I see the world ending another day. I live a lone life, live in seclusion and solitude. I hate everyone and everything.
With the power of my AR you will all know who I am. I had enough of being told what to do and when to do. I had enough of being -- telling me that I'm a idiot and a dumb ass, when real life you're all the dumb ass. You're all stupid and brainwashed by these fucking political government programs. You will all see. You will all know who my name is.
My love for you, Angie, will never go away. I hope to see you in the afterlife. From one day or another you will end and we'll all die. Hello. My name is Nick and
I'm gonna be the next school shooter of 2018.
My goal is at least 20 people with an AR-15 and a couple tracer rounds. I think I can do -- get done.
Location is Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, Florida. It's gonna be a big event. And when you see me on the news, you'll all know who I am (laughing). You're all going to die. Pew, pew-pew, pew, pew, pew, pew. Ah, yeah. Can't wait.

I've been watching Bowling for Columbine. How am I different than what the media says school shooters are? TV I watch: Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien, Family Guy, SNL, Mad TV, Simpsons, Law and Order, Monk, and others. oh, South Park! Man Show (Jimmy + Ad Music: Country music! Toby Keith! Movies: ok, movie I watch have some violence. Groose Pointe Blank, South Park, The Frighteners, Cruel Intentions, Animal House, Blown Away, 10 Things I Hate About You (yes a chick flick) and others, just ask my friends. I like to laugh! Comedies are good! I'm not what the media says I should be. But why Columbia (other than I hate it for obvious reasons)? About eleven months ago, I was in Four Winds. I told a couple people (Barry, Brad) because they wouldn't care. But I guess everyone knew. And one day, Four Winds received a fax about people from Columbia saying that I said "I am going to kill myself and no one can stop me." I figure that's why I was there longer than I should have. So Columbia, IT'S YOUR FAULT. It was said that I "studied" Columbine and was trying to repeat it. That's just ridiculous. Plenty of things were said by the D.A. that were ridiculous, like that I wasn't sorry. I've prayed for all those who were affected on that day. I've apologized to many, and been forgiven by many more. I now pray for those killed, wounded, and for the family of all those affected in the latest shooting in Minnesota. Please nobody follow in mine or other's footsteps by bringing a weapon to school. Please don't even try to take your own life. Life is too precious whether you notice or not. Always remember if you hurt yourself or others, you'll also be hurting your family and loved ones or theirs. Jon Romano
